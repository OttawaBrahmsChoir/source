The Ottawa Brahms Choir is a diverse, fun and community-oriented choir. Our
primary musical repertoire is in German, but we often sing in English, French,
Latin and Russian as well. We practice weekly on **Mondays at 7pm** in the
[Southminster United Church][map].  Prospective members are encouraged to join
us at any time during the season. It's a fun, no-commitment and *no-audition
process*!

As a group, we're passionate about music, but we also like to have fun! We have
monthly pub nights to let our hair down and get to know one another better
outside of regular practice.

We are always interested in new people who like to sing. We like to see new
members in each of the four voices. Because the choir is currently lacking in
tenors and basses, new male members will be given an especially warm welcome!

The 2018 season rehearsals start September 10th.

If you are interested please drop by a practice, or contact [Sieglinde
Phaneuf][siglinde] for more information.
