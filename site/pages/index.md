### About Us

The Ottawa Brahms Choir was founded in 1980 by Dieter Kiesewalter as a local
German community Choir. Currently directed by Christopher Askwith and
accompanied by Svetlana Logigan, the choir continues to offer audiences a wide
range of choral music, from classical to contemporary, while maintaining its
roots in the German repertoire.

The choir rehearses at Southminster United Church, on the corner of Bank and
Aylmer, every Monday evenings at 7 pm.
